# binary_tree


In this implementation, the Node class represents a single node in the binary tree, and the BinaryTree class represents the tree itself. The insert method adds a new Â node to the tree in the correct location based on its value, and the search method searches for a node with a specific value and returns true if it exists in the tree, or false otherwise.
